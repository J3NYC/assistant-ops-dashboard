# Assistant Ops Dashboard

A lightweight self-hosted dashboard for monitoring and controlling an OpenClaw assistant environment.

## What it does
- Checks OpenClaw health/status
- Shows raw status output for quick debugging
- Lets you restart the gateway from the UI
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

## Why I built this
I wanted a simple operational panel for assistant uptime and troubleshooting without digging through terminal logs every time.
2) Add topics on GitHub repo page
Use:

nodejs

3) Next 3 features (great commits)
Service uptime badge + status color
Recent logs panel (openclaw logs --tail 100)
Cron jobs view (list upcoming scheduled jobs)
If you want, I can give you the exact code for feature #1 right now so you can make a second commit immediately.
